# About

I'm Haleem Bello (aka `genialtechie`), a Full Stack Developer based in Atlanta, GA. I build performance-first web apps with strong UX, clean systems, and accessibility baked in.

## Highlights

- 4+ years building and shipping production web apps
- Co-founded Magpollo and delivered 30+ client projects end-to-end (UI, APIs, databases, CI/CD)
- Core stack: TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL/Supabase, Docker

## Now

I'm focused on product work and interactive experiences, where performance and polish matter.
