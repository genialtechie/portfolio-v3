# About

I'm Haleem Bello (aka `genialtechie`), a Full Stack Developer based in Atlanta, GA. I like building things that feel fast, intentional, and a little bit magical, without being fragile.

## Highlights

- World Robotics Olympiad: builder, Sochi, Russia (Team Nigeria)
- Grillz Configurator: high-framerate 3D customization experience
- Qualifies.me: AI-powered resume optimization tool
- Magpollo: co-founded, shipped 30+ client projects end-to-end

## Now

I'm focused on product work and interactive experiences where performance and polish actually matter.
