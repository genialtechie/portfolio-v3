# Welcome

This is the macOS overlay. It is intentionally lazy-loaded so the 3D scene stays fast.

## How To Edit Content

- Add markdown files in `content/`.
- File names control ordering (alphabetical), so prefixes like `01_`, `02_` work well.
- The sidebar is generated automatically from the folder.

## Shortcuts

- `Esc`: close overlay
